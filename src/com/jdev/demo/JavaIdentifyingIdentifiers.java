     * An identifier is the name of a variable,
     * method, class, interface, or package.
     *
     *
     * There are only four rules to remember for legal identifiers:
     *
     * Identifiers must begin with a letter, a $ symbol, or a _ symbol.
     *
     * Identifiers can include numbers but not start with them.
     *
     * Since Java 9, a single underscore _ is not allowed as an identifier.
     *
     * You cannot use the same name as a Java reserved word. A
     * reserved word is special word that Java has held aside so that you
     * are not allowed to use it. Remember that Java is case sensitive, so
     * you can use versions of the keywords that only differ in case.
     * Please donâ€™t, though.
